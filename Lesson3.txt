Contents of Lesson 3 will be posted here :D I can't believe I'm actually learning Git!!

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I would like to have my work saved online, as a backup or if I want to callaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you know you always have the current & most up to date version of your file, when you need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are someone elses work on github that you are making a copy of and modifying it for your owns needs it gets put directly into github, clones are a copy of a github repository aswell but they don't get hosted directly onto your github when you clone it is local, branches are different versions of the same file, for example a game in a different language or an easier/harder version of the game, or the game with another background etc. You choose one instead of the other based off of your goals.
