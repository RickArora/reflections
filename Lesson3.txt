Contents of Lesson 3 will be posted here :D I can't believe I'm actually learning Git!!

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I would like to have my work saved online, as a backup or if I want to callaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you know you always have the current & most up to date version of your file, when you need it.
